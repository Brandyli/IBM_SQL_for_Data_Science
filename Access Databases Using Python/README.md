## Creating Db2 Service Credentials
* port is the database port
* db is the database name
* host is the hostname of the database instance
* username is the username you'll use to connect
* password is the password you'll use to connect (you may need to scroll down to see the password)
* URI (you will need this for Jupyter notebooks when using SQL Magic)

## Connecting to a database instance

This will demonstrate how to create a database connection to an instance of IBM Db2 on Cloud. You will be using Jupyter notebooks to complete the labs.

## Creating tables, loading data and querying data

This Lab will demonstrate how to create tables in a database, insert some rows of data into the table, invoke SQL queries, and retrieve the query result set. 

## Accessing Databases with SQL magic

You will create a table, insert some data, and retrieve the results using SQL magic.

## Analyzing Socioeconomic Dataset of Chicago with SQL and Python
In this lab you will learn how to store a real world data set from the internet in a database (Db2 on IBM Cloud), gain insights into data using SQL queries. You also visualized a portion of the data in the database using seaborn (bar and scatter plot) to see what story it tells.
