## Creating Db2 Service Credentials
* port is the database port
* db is the database name
* host is the hostname of the database instance
* username is the username you'll use to connect
* password is the password you'll use to connect (you may need to scroll down to see the password)
* URI (you will need this for Jupyter notebooks when using SQL Magic)
